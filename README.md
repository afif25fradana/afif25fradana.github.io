# Hey there! Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is where I keep the code for my personal website and portfolio. Think of it as my digital home base, built with some good old HTML, styled up with the magic of Tailwind CSS, and brought to life with a touch of JavaScript.
