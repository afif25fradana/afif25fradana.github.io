# Hey there! Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! 👋

This repository is where I keep the code for my personal website and portfolio. Think of it as my digital home base, built with some good old HTML, styled up with the magic of Tailwind CSS, and brought to life with a touch of JavaScript.

## What's Inside? 📂

Here's a quick peek at the main files you'll find:

-   `index.html`: This is the main page, the front door to my website.
-   `style.css`: My custom styles, for those unique touches not covered by Tailwind.
-   `input.css`: The starting point for Tailwind CSS to do its thing.
-   `script.js`: Where all the interactive bits and bobs live.
-   `tailwind.config.js`: My personal settings for Tailwind CSS.
-   `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`: These are just the usual suspects for managing all the tools and libraries this project uses. I'm using `pnpm` for package management, which is pretty neat!

## Tech Stack I'm Rocking 🚀

-   **HTML5**: The foundation of the web!
-   **CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS)**: For making things look good, fast and efficiently.
-   **JavaScript**: Adding dynamic flair and functionality.
-   **Node.js**: Powers the development tools, especially for getting Tailwind CSS ready.
-   **pnpm**: My go-to package manager for this project.

## Want to Run It Locally? Here's How! 💻

If you're curious and want to see this project running on your own machine, it's super easy:

1.  **Grab a copy of the code:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/afif25fradana/afif25fradana.github.io.git
    cd afif25fradana.github.io
    ```

2.  **Get the tools ready:**
    This project uses `pnpm`. If you don't have it yet, you can install it globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
    Then, let `pnpm` install all the project's dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Fire it up! 🔥**
    I usually have a script to get things going. Check the `package.json` file for scripts like `dev` or `start`. You can run them like this:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    # or maybe
    pnpm run build
    ```
    If there isn't a specific development server, you can just open `index.html` directly in your web browser. Easy peasy!
